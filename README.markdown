## Rework
- This is a fork from [here](https://github.com/YaccConstructor/QuickGraph) where he implemented Tarjan's algorithm based on the answer from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6643076/tarjan-cycle-detection-help-c-sharp). 
- On that SO post, [Roger Hill presented a refactored version that was a little cleaner and didn't use a stack](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36489758/494635).
- This project does the following
    - Move everything to netstandard2 with xunit tests
    - Implement Roger Hill's example as 'version 2'.


Thanks everyone :-)
