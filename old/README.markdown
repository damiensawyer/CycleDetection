Just decided to put together a c# project for an implementation of the Tarjan cycle detection algorithm as I can't seem to find any out there already.

The original code for this was posted on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6643076/tarjan-cycle-detection-help-c-sharp) by [user623879](http://stackoverflow.com/users/623879/user623879). 

Hope this is useful!
